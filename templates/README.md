# templates

The templates are described using [Nunjuncks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

The boilerplate templates are exploiting the Data.vlaanderen.be style. Adapt them to your needs.

The 3.0 directory contains the templates for the 3.0 version of the toolchain. These should not be used anymore for the 4.0 version of the toolchain. The templates that are used within the 4.0 version of the 
toolchain are located in root of the directory, being /templates.
